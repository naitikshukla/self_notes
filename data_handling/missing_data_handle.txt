Different ways to handle missing values.

1. Delete rows with missing data. (Consider only if the data is huge and missing values are very less in number).
2. Mean/Median/Mode imputation. (Median preferred for data with outliers).
3. Assigning a random value to them (random imputation between mean and 2 standard deviations on both sides).
4. Predicting the missing values using Machine Learning Models.
5. Using an algorithm that supports missing values, like Random Forest.
6. KNN imputation
7. Imputation Using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE)
8. Imputation Using Deep Learning (Datawig)
